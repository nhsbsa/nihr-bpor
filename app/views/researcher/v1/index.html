<h1>Recruit Registry Volunteers</h1>

<p>Setting up an account on Recruit Registry Volunteers will enable you to create a pre-screener to send to potential volunteers for your study</p>
<p>This is an overview of the platform:</p>

<ul>
  <li>While creating the pre-screener, you will be able to save it at any point and continue later.</li>
  <li>Once submitted, your pre-screener will be sent to our admins for approval.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once approved, a link to pre-screener will be sent to volunteers by email.</p>
<p>After your volunteers fill out the pre-screener and submit it, you will be able to see the results on this platform.</p>
